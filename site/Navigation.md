This page covers navigation information and user interface tips; the basic features offered by obsidian. 

# Interface

The interface can be split into three components, the content in the middle, the sidebar on the left, and the sidebar on the right.

## Middle Content

### Links

[[About|Red]] links lead to other pages on the site, which open in an adjacent page. [Blue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvFZjo5PgG0) links lead to webpages outside the site, and are automatically opened in a new tab.

### Page Hover

If enabled, hovering over an [[About|internal]] link will bring up a preview modal brings up a preview of that page.

### Backlinks

If enabled backlinks will be shown at the bottom of the page. These are pages that link to the page you are currently on.

### Page Scroll

Each page has it's own independent vertical scroll, however you can also scroll left and right through the pages. If you open many pages, you can return to a specific one by clicking on the left edge of the page and it will automatically horizontally scroll you to that page.

### Closing Pages 

You can close a single page by clicking the red `x` on the bottom left corner of the page.

### Tags 

If tags are in use, then clicking a tag will open a model showing all the pages with that tag.

#example-tag

### Heading Copy 

Hovering over a heading will manifest a copy button next to the heading. Clicking this will add the URL to that heading to your clipboard.

## Left Sidebar 

You can open the left sidebar by hovering over the animation at the top left, or anywhere else on the far left.

### Search Bar  

The search bar indexes page titles and headers.

### Page Index 

Below the search bar is an alphabetically organized index of pages and directories on the site.

## Right Sidebar 

On the right is a dark blue bar. Hovering over this will expand the right sidebar.

### Table of Contents 

At the top is a table of contents. If you are on a particularly long page, the table of contents has its own independent scroll. Clicking on a heading in the TOC will bring you to that heading in the page.

### Local Graph 

Below the table of contents is an interactive local graph that displays your current page and the pages linked to your current page.
