Welcome to this [obsidian](https://obsidian.md) site. It's a demo of and (optimally will be) the documentation for a minimalist obsidian [publish](https://obsidian.md/publish) theme I'm working on called [mintel](https://github.com/harttraveller/mintel-theme).

## Notes

- Other pages are being written, but will be linked here soon.
- I need to reorganize the CSS in the publish theme.
- When I get around to it, I intend to make an python CLI tool to autogenerate customized obsidian publish themes based on this one.
