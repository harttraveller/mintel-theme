Welcome to the [mintel](https://github.com/harttraveller/mintel-theme/blob/main/publish.css) theme docs. This is an open source project with the goal of creating a minimal and 'intelligent' theme for the [publish](https://obsidian.md/publish) service offered by [obsidian](https://obsidian.md). If you want a feature added or encounter a bug, don't hesitate to submit it in 

If you like this project, feel free to check out my [portfolio](https://harttraveller.com) site.
